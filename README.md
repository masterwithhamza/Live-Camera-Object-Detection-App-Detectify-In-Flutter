The Object Detection App "Detectify" in Flutter is a powerful application designed to perform real-time object detection using the Flutter framework. Leveraging machine learning models, Detectify can identify and classify various objects in images and live camera feeds. The app features a user-friendly interface that allows users to capture photos or use their device's camera to detect objects, displaying results with high accuracy and speed. It utilizes Flutter's cross-platform capabilities to deliver a seamless experience on both Android and iOS devices. Detectify is an excellent example of integrating AI-powered features into mobile applications, providing developers with a foundation to build advanced object detection and recognition systems.
